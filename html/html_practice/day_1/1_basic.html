        <h4>Dogs</h4>
        <img src="./images/dogs.png" alt="dog image" />
        <p>The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
            The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living
            relative.
            The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the
            development of agriculture.
            Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior, leading to a large
            number of domestic individuals and the ability to thrive on
            a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
            The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
            attributes.
            Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
            herding,
            pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
            companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence on human society has given them the
            sobriquet
            of <q><strong>Man's best friend.</strong></q>
        <blockquote>"man's best friend."</blockquote>

        <h4>Cats</h4>

        <pre>
        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
        [1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic
        cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a
        feral cat;
        the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
        their ability
        to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]
        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species:
        it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted
        to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
        Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and
        grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular),
        the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
        human ears,
        such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]

        <h4>Fish</h4>
        <img src="./images/fish.jpg" alt="fish image" />
        <p>Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits.
            They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
            Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as
            various
            extinct related groups.
            Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95%
            belonging to the teleost subgrouping.
            The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during
            the
            Cambrian period.
            Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their
            invertebrate counterparts.
            Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms.
            Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators.
            The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became
            formidable
            marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.
