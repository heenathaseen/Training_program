        <h1>Indoor Plants</h1>

        <p>Indoor plants thrive indoors in your home or office. 
            Not only are they decorative, they also give out oxygen
            and have immense psychological benefits. Many of the plants here also 
            absorb harmful compounds from the air around and reduce indoor pollution.
